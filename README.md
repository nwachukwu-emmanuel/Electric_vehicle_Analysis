# <h1>ELECTRIC VEHICLES: A MARKET SIZE EXPLORATION</h1>

## Project Overview:
This project explores the growth and current state electric vehicle (EV) market using data-driven analysis.
It examines trends, vehicle characteristics, geographical patterns and market potential to provide insights into the adoption and distribution of EVs.

## Objectives
The main goals od this project are:
- Analyze **EV adoption over time** to identify growth patterns.
- Study the **geogrphical distribution** of EVs across cities.
- Categorize the **EV types** and compare their prevalence.
- Evaluate **make and model popularity** in the EV market.
- Conduct an **electric range analysis** to assess performance.
- Estimate the **current and potential market size**.

## Tools
- **Python:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **IDE:** VS Code
- **Data Format:** CSV


## Result and Insights

**Adoption Trends**
- Significant growth in EV registrations from 2011 - 2023.
- Sharp increase post-2020 whmight be attributed to policy incentives.
- Sharp decline in EV registration between 2023 and 2024.

**Geographical Insights**
- King, Snohomish, and Pierce counties are the top 3 counties
- Seattle city has the highest number of registrered EV followed by Bellevue and Redmond respectively taking the 2nd and 3rd ranking
- the top 3 cities are all located in the King county.

**Electric Vehicle Type**
- 2 types of EV were identified from this data
- Battery Electric Vehicle and Plug-in Hybrid Electric
- Users prefer the Battery EV than Plug-in Hybrid EV

**Popular Manufacturers**
- TESLA dominates the EV manufacturers
- CHEVROLET ranked 2nd closely follwed by NISSAN at the 3rd position

**Popular Model**
- TESLA Models (Y, and 3) dominates the EV space
- NISSAN LEAF is the 3rd most popular EV

**Electric Ranges**
- High frequency of Low electric range EVs
- Most TESLA's EVs are high electric range vehicle

**EV Type Evolution**
- Significant rise in battery electric vehicles (BEV) from 2016 - 2023 with a decline from 2023 - 2025
- Steady rise in plug-in electric vehicles (PHEV) from 2016 - 2024 with a decline from 2024 - 2025
- The BEVs are more popular than the PHEVs.

**EV Market Estimation**
- The EV market is expected to see a gradual rise in the next 5 years

## **<h2>PROJECT LIMITATIONS</h2>**
- This project utilized EV registration data from the state of Washington in the US
- A prediction model was not used to estimate future market size

## **<h2>FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS</h2>**
- Add EV registration data from other states and possibly other countries.
- Use a predictive model to predict future EV market size.
- Include charging infrastructure analysis.
- Access carbon footprint reduction impact.
